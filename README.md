# Data Compression

This repo provides teaching resources for (mostly lossy) data compression.

## About

It was originally intended for students in computer science (Durham University COMP3687).
I'm now seeing which parts can be refactored to support digital humanities classes (for KCL, Department of Digital Humanities).

The licence is CC-By-SA.

## Contributing

Feedback, requests, suggestions are all welcome.

Thanks and happy compressing,
