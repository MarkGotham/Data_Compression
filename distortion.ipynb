       "Video compression is based on two kinds of redundancy:\n",
       "- Spatial redundancy: Each frame (effectively an image) features 'redundancy' in pixel correlation.\n",
       "    (each pixel is likely to be similar to its immediate neighbours).\n",
       "- Temporal redundancy:\n",
       "    Most frames in a video are likely to be very similar to its immediate neighbour (predecessor and successor).\n",
       "\n",
       "A typical technique for video compression involves:\n",
       "- encoding the first frame using a still image compression method.\n",
       "- encodes several successive frames in terms of their difference from the frame before.\n",
