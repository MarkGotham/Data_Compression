## Background

- The term 'wavelet' refers to a brief, wave-like oscillation of amplitude ($y$) against time ($x$).
    - The amplitude begins at $0$, pulses away one or more times, and returns to end at $0$.
- There are many 'families' of wavelets (broadly on the specific number and shape of the constituent pulses).
- There are also many use cases, including for our purposes of data compression.


## Task

- Type:
    Exploration
- Task:
    Explore
    the 'pywavelets' wavelet library
    using either or both of
    - the [Wavelet browser](https://wavelets.pybytes.com/)
    - a local copy of the library (`import pywavelets`, note, renamed from `pwyt`)
- Bonus:
  - Implement (re-create) one or more wavelets from scratch.
  - Demonstrate the properties of a given wavelet (e.g., integral sum to 0).

This exercise is exploratory.
Optionally, you can also demonstrate the two properties above.
