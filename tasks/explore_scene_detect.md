## Background

There are several python libraries for scene change detection.
This notebook demonstrates a basic, 'off-the-shelf' use of the `scenedetect` library.

Installation:
-`pip install scenedetect`
- and you'll also need `pip install opencv-python` if you don't have it already.

The notebook also assumes you have the whole repository 
or at least the `dummy_video.mp4` located at `/tasks/dummy_video.mp4` relative to this notebook.


## Task

- Type: Explore
- Task: Import and explore `scikit-image` and/or another one of above libraries for handling images.
- Bonus: Explore other videos to test this system in more complex settings.
