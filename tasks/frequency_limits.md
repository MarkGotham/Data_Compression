## Background

The basilar membrane is not infinitely long:
it in limited in length, and therefore, the range of frequencies we can process is limited.
The range of human hearing is often given as 20 to 20,000 Hz.
As you might expect, these are not simply, hard-and-fast cut off limits,
and nor is our ability to hear equal across this range.
Rather, our perception is best (most sensitive) in the middle between about 1,500 and 4,000 Hz,
and the overall range may be greater or (more usually) smaller.


## Task

- Type: Implement
- Task: Return to your $Î» = v/f$ function (see `wavelength.md`) and 
    add reference lines for the humanly audible range of 20 to 20,000 Hz.
    Calculate the wavelengths corresponding to 20 and 20,000 Hz and add those as reference lines too.
- Reference implementation: `wavelen_vel_freq.plot_wavelength(reference_lines=True)`
