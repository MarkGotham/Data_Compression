## Background

In some data, there's a clear pattern.
For example a 'sine' wave goes up and down in a regular way.
This kind of patterning can be seen in sound files, images, and much more besides.
It is a key part of how we simply and compress complex data.
This notebook encourages you to explore that phenomena.


## Task

- Type: Explore
- Task: Create a sin wave (periodic) and noise profile, then
    - Plot it as data.
    - Create corresponding audio
    - Display it as a colour profile (mapped to 2D for convenience)


## Also on this repository

Here, we create (synthesise) the data from scratch: from parameters to sound signal.
Data compression means going in the other direction:
taking existing periodic data and 
working out the approximate sources.
