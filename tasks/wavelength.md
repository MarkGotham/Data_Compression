## Background

Simple sounds are periodic.
The simplest consist of a single periodic sine wave:
i.e., a regular oscillation at a specific frequency. 
The longer the wavelength, the ‘lower’ the frequency; the shorter the wavelength, the ‘higher’ the frequency.
So, wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other.

The equation connecting them conventionally uses:
- the Greek letter ‘lambda’ ($λ$) for wavelength.
- $f$ for frequency, typically measuring this in the number of oscillations (cycles) completed each second (cycles per second, or ‘Hertz’, ‘Hz’).
- $v$ for the velocity (broadly speaking, the ‘speed’). Sound waves travel at . . . the speed of sound! This is ~343 m/s.

## Task

- Type: Implement
- Task: Plot $λ=v/f$, for a fixed value of v=343 m/s. including a line for v.
- Reference implementation: `wavelen_vel_freq.plot_wavelength()`
